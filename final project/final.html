      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This project aimed to develop a Blender add-on that procedurally
        generates furniture of four different kinds: dressers, tables, chairs,
        and beds, with unique geometry and texture for each generated object.
        The add-on was successfully implemented, allowing users to create a wide
        variety of unique furniture quickly and easily, speeding up the modeling
        process for projects with tight deadlines.

      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Our technical approach involved using the Blender API to create an
        add-on that procedurally generates furniture. We implemented algorithms
        for generating the geometry and texture of each furniture type, based on
        techniques from
        <a

        >
        and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFQMNcTj5Jw"
          >CG Python's Blender Scripting Guide: Mastering Mesh Editing with
          Python</a
        >. Our approaches differed from the references in a few ways â€” for
        example, instead of modeling the bed entirely computationally, we
        instead modeled it by hand and randomly changed the style (texture,
        size) of the bed. Also, for the texture generation code, we used real
        wood and fabric pictures for the wood and fabric textures since the
        settings in Blender alone were insufficient to create the level of
        detail we wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past weeks, our team implemented a set of Python scripts for
        generating randomized 3D models of furniture items in Blender. The
        furniture types covered include beds, chairs, dressers, and tables. Each
        script utilizes Blender's bpy and bmesh libraries to procedurally
        generate the 3D models with varying dimensions, materials, and features.
        The goal is to create a diverse set of realistic furniture models that
        can be used in various applications such as interior design
        visualization, game development, or virtual environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bed generation script starts by defining functions to create
        different material types, including metal, fabric, plastic, and wood.
        These functions utilize Blender's node-based material system to set up
        shaders and textures that mimic the appearance of the respective
        materials. The main bed creation function then generates the individual
        components of the bed, such as the frame, mattress, pillows, and quilt.
        The dimensions and materials of these components are randomized within
        predefined ranges to create variation. The script also handles the
        positioning and scaling of the components relative to each other to
        ensure a cohesive bed structure. Additionally, it applies modifiers like
        beveling to enhance the visual appearance of the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chair generation script follows a similar approach, utilizing the
        same functions to create materials. The main chair creation function
        generates the seat, backrest, legs, and an optional cushion of the
        chair. The seat shape is then randomly selected between a cube and a
        cylinder, and the dimensions of each component are randomized. Like with
        the bed, the chair script also applies beveling and subdivision to
        smooth out edges and surfaces. Finally, the chosen materials are
        assigned to the chair components to give it a realistic appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dresser generation script creates a dresser with a varying number of
        drawers, legs, and a flat base. It utilizes the bmesh library to create
        the basic geometry of the dresser body, drawers, and knobs out of
        primitive components. The script then randomizes the number of rows and
        columns of drawers, as well as their dimensions and spacing, and then
        positions the elements correctly. It also randomly decides if legs or a
        base will be included. After the geometry is defined, the script assigns
        random materials (wood, plastic, or metal) to the dresser body, drawers,
        and knobs to add variety. Finally, it recalculates the UV coordinates of
        the dresser components to ensure proper texture mapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table generation script generates a randomized table with a top and
        four legs. It starts by deleting any existing table objects in the scene
        to avoid duplicates. The script then randomizes the dimensions of the
        table top and legs. The table top shape is randomly selected between a
        cube and a cylinder, and the corresponding geometry is created using
        Blender's primitive operations. Like with the other furniture, the
        script applies beveling and subdivision to the table top to achieve
        smoother edges. The table legs are created as cylinders and positioned
        based on the table top shape and dimensions. Finally, a random plastic
        material with a randomized color is assigned to the table and legs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the furniture generation process, the scripts utilize various
        techniques to add realism and variation to the models. These include
        randomizing dimensions within predefined ranges, selecting random
        materials and textures, applying modifiers like beveling and
        subdivision, and positioning components relative to each other.
        Blender's bpy and bmesh libraries were instrumental in making this
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the implemented furniture generation scripts demonstrate
        the power of procedural modeling techniques in creating diverse and
        realistic 3D models. By leveraging Blender's capabilities and
        randomizing various aspects of the furniture, our team has developed a
        flexible and efficient workflow for generating a wide range of furniture
        items. These generated models can be used in various applications,
        saving time and effort in manual modeling while maintaining a high level
        of visual quality and variation.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the main challenges we encountered was the complexity of
        scripting the bed generation. We tackled this by saving the current bed
        model and then using a script to randomly change its style, texture, and
        size. Another issue was generating realistic wood and fabric textures,
        which we solved by using real pictures of wood and fabric in the texture
        generation code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project, we learned how to use the Blender API to create an
        add-on, implement procedural generation algorithms for geometry and
        textures, and integrate our scripts into a cohesive package. We also
        gained experience in project management, dividing tasks among team
        members based on their strengths and coordinating our efforts to meet
        deadlines.
